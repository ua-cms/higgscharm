    Apply electron scale and smearing corrections for Run3

    from docs https://egammapog.docs.cern.ch/Run3/SaS/

    The purpose of scale and smearing (more formal: energy scale and resolution corrections) is to correct and calibrate electron and photon energies in data and MC. This step is performed after the MC-based semi-parametric EGamma energy regression, which is applied to both MC and data (aiming to correct for inherent imperfections that are not in principle related to data/MC differences like crystal-by-crystal differences, intermodule gaps, ...). The remaining differences between the electron and photon energy scales and the resolution in the data and simulation need to be corrected for. To address this, a multistep procedure is implemented to calibrate the residual energy scale in data. Additionally, an extra smearing is applied to the electron or photon energy in simulation to ensure that the energy resolution matches that observed in data
